# House Prices Regression & Clustering

In this repository we discuss possible solutions for the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview/description" target="_blank">House Prices</a> challenge from Kaggle. <br>

The house prices dataset consists in 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. <br>
The target of this competition is to predict the final price of each home.

The solutions will be runned in a Mac OS X 10.15 operating system with python=3.9 and mainly with the pycaret library.
The solutions are divided into two different notebooks (one for each part). <br>

## 1. House Prices Clustering
In the fist part we will analyse the correlation of the dataset features.
The solution of this task with the proper explanations is located in <a href="https://github.com/aldotopciu/dm-house-prices/blob/main/clustering/house_prices_clustering.ipynb">dm-house-prices/clustering/house_prices_clustering.ipynb</a> notebook.



## 2. House Prices Regression
In the second part we are going to predict the final price of each home by using advanced regression techniques. <br>
The solution of this task with the proper explanations is located in <a href="https://github.com/aldotopciu/dm-house-prices/blob/main/regression/house_prices_regression.ipynb">dm-house-prices/regression/house_prices_regression.ipynb</a> notebook.

### The notebooks requirements for execution are specified in the <a href="https://github.com/aldotopciu/dm-house-prices/blob/main/requirements.txt">requirments.txt</a> file.
